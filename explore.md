You decide to venture into the forest, feeling the thrill of adventure coursing through your veins. The sunlight filters through the leaves, creating a dappled pattern on the forest floor. As you walk, you hear a rustling in the bushes.

Suddenly, a small, shimmering fairy appears before you.

“Hello, traveler!” she says. “I can guide you to the treasure, but you must help me first. A mischievous goblin has stolen my magic wand. Will you help me retrieve it?”
